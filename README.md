# DiscordBot
Building a Discord bot with Go

### Functionality
We will ultimately want a handful of commands and features for the bot. For now,
it will simply organize calls.

#### Organize Calls
- The bot should open up a post to allow people to react to a post indicating that they
can thumbs up the post to get notified when a call will start. The timezone is hardcoded to EST.

`!botname 1/1 1:00PM Event Title Here` - Organizes "Event Title Here " for 1/1 at 1 PM of the current year in EST.

Additionally functionality will be added in the future.
